* Read a short Intro to markdown
* Update README and try to get consensus on what we are doing
* Document where the Canada data are coming from
	* or else, use the Delve data first?

* Don't do statistics until we have a statistics plan

* For now: make a plan for what data to download, how to organize it and how to visualize it
	* See if you can figure out how to control the dates on whatever data you want to use
	* Let JD work with you on caching data

Together
========

* Work on download pipeline and data caching
