Research Questions
* How can we interpret the test positivity rate? What factors affect this interpretation? 

** The test positivity rate is being used to draw conclusions regarding whether a region is conducting sufficient testing, how well the outbreak is being managed, and serves as a key factor in deciding whether to change intervention measures (i.e. loosen lockdown measures).  How should the interpretation in a region with consistent testing and reporting measures differ from one with inconsistent measures or limited health surveillance? 

* Which factors of the[Global Health Security Index](https://www.ghsindex.org/) were most important in a region's preparedness and response to an outbreak? 

** With the US ranked 1st out of all 195 countries on the index, but failing to contain COVID-19 outbreaks in many states, the overall scores do not appear to be predictive of a region's performance.  However, within the category scores, the US ranked quite low in health systems, healthcare access, clinic, hospital, and community care capacity (290 hospital beds per 100,000), public confidence in government (> 25%), and ranked 59th out of 195 on political and security risks and socio-economic resilience. Regions such as South Korea, Vietnam and Germany did quite well but were ranked significantly lower.
