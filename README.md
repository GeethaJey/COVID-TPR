# COVID-TPR

Potential Research Questions
* How can we interpret the test positivity rate of a given region based on the characteristics of the population and interventions within that region? 
* How can the test positivity rate of a region be used inform decisions regarding testing and interventions? 
* How did the use of TPR as a key metric used for re-opening guidelines affect testing methods and population selected for testing? 
Original Questions
* How we interpret test-positivity rates?
* What factors about _testing_ policy affect this interpretation?

Geetha's Questions
* How does intervention policy affect COVID spread?
* How well did the Global Health Security Index predict pandemic response? What factors of the index
