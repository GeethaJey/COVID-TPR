# COVID-TPR

Potential Research Questions
* How can we interpret the test positivity rate of a given region based on the characteristics of the population and interventions within that region? 
* How can the test positivity rate of a region be used inform decisions regarding testing and interventions? 

Original Questions
* How we interpret test-positivity rates?
* What factors about _testing_ policy affect this interpretation?

Geetha's Questions
* How does intervention policy affect COVID spread?

How to Answer these questions
- We can assess the factors affecting the test positivity rate over time. For example, a region's testing protocols determine the requirements to receive a test, and thus can sigificantly affect the test positivity rate if only those with a high probability of having the infection are being tested.
