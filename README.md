# COVID-TPR

Potential Research Questions
* How can we interpret the test positivity rate? How does this interpretation change based on the characteristics of the testing, demographics and interventions within a region?
    * How can we interpret the TPR in countries with inconsistent general outpatient attendance, testing practices, and reporting completeness (based on WHO suggestions for when to use TPR instead of incidence rates to assess transmission)? 
* How should the test positivity rate of a region be used inform decisions regarding testing and interventions? 
* How did the use of TPR as a key metric used for re-opening guidelines affect testing methods and population selected for testing? 

Original Questions
* How we interpret test-positivity rates?
* What factors about _testing_ policy affect this interpretation?

Geetha's Questions
* How does intervention policy affect COVID spread?
* How well did the [Global Health Security Index](https://www.ghsindex.org/) predict pandemic response? What factors of the index were most important to successful containment? 
    *South Korea, Vietnam and Germany were highlighted in an Exemplars of Global Health report, with an analysis of each country's methods of prevention, detection, containment and treatment. Looking at which factors of the Global Health Security Index were most important to success would be interesting, as Vietnam and Germany received 44/100 and 66/100 respectively, but did a much better job than higher scoring countries (e.g. the US, UK).
